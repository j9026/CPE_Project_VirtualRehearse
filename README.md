# CPE_Project_VirtualRehearse

Virtual Rehearse is a virtual reality public speaking practice platform built using Wonderland Engine and JavaScript. The project is designed to help users rehearse speeches in realistic, immersive environments that better simulate the pressure and atmosphere of real presentations. Instead of practicing in front of a mirror or camera, users can step into virtual venues and rehearse under conditions that feel closer to an actual audience.

The experience includes multiple rehearsal environments, ranging from a classroom to a lecture hall and an auditorium, allowing users to gradually scale difficulty. A fully interactive timer system lets users set, start, pause, hide, and synchronize countdown timers across scenes, with an audio alarm signaling the end of a session. Navigation between worlds is handled through teleportation, creating a smooth and intuitive flow between the welcome screen, menu, and rehearsal environments.

This project was developed as a course final project and focuses on accessibility, modular design, and extensibility. While currently tested in a desktop setup, the system is structured for future VR headset integration, higher-resolution environments, and additional features such as movement, recording, and expanded venue options.
